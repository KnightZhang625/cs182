# Berkeley CS182/282 Designing, Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks
Self study on CS182/CS282 - Designing, Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks (Spring 2019) @ UC Berkeley. Includes assignments, lecture slides, and lecture notes. Solutions passed all the self-contained unit tests but were not submitted using student-only submission system.

## Assignment1: :heavy_check_mark:
Done using Python 3.7. Migrated original course's Python 2.7 assignment to Python 3.7. This assignment is adopted from Stanford CS 231n assignment 2.

## Assignment2: :heavy_check_mark:
Done using Python 3.7. Network visualization and style transfer done using pytorch 1.2. This assignment is adopted from Stanford CS 231n assigment 3. Also implemented GAN notebook from Stanford cs231n assignment 3. 

## Assignment3: :heavy_check_mark:
Done using Python 3.7 and tensorflow 2.0 in `tensorflow.compat.v1` mode. Got 4.54 validation loss with default transformer hyper params vs. possible <= 4.5 indicated in the assignment notebook. Batch size limited by GPU memory.

## Assignment4: :heavy_check_mark:
Done using Python 3.7 and Tensorflow 2.0 in `tensorflow.compat.v1` mode. Migraded codes in `train_dqn.py` from `Tensorflow 1.10` to `Tensorflow 1.15`. Pong won't train ```Unknown encoder 'libx264'``` causing ```ERROR: VideoRecorder encoder exited with status 1```.
